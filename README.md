The project was deployed in two version. A light version using only JavaScript/HTML/CSS that tracks only real time results that can be accesed [here](https://gpivaro.github.io/Project_2/). The full version of this project has a back-end compose of Python and MySQL and it is available [here](https://airtraffic-live.herokuapp.com/).

## Background

### Data Source

The main data source to build our live tracker dashboard is the free API from [The OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/). A short description of the The OpenSky Network is the following.

The OpenSky Network [live REST API](https://opensky-network.org/api) provides JSON object with geolocation info about the aircrafts using [Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast (ADS-B)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast). This project queries the The OpenSky Network API every 5 min for the full version of this [dashboard](https://airtraffic-live.herokuapp.com/) and every user access for the [light version](https://airtraffic-live.herokuapp.com/).

Besides the live data described above, this application utilizes airport information based on the data available 


### Dashboard Visualizations

Convert icao24 to registration number:
http://www.avionictools.com/icao.php
Ex: icao24 -> a8102a  ---->  N61898
Use the registration number (N...) to search for aircraft

#### Weather API:

#### Next Steps:

* Connect a database and query the main API every x seconds to keep track of the aircrafts movement.

* Associate the aircrafts with the airports (to/from).

* Track the airports traffic.

* Insert dropdown menus for user interaction.

* Add layers for aircrafts, airports, weather, etc.

* Add a search field to the user search by aircraft or airport

* Add stats for individual flights and airports
